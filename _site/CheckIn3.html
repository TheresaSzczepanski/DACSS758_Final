<section id="research-question" class="level1">
<h1>Research Question</h1>
<p>I work for a public charter school in Massachusetts. Our students in Grades 5-10 are tested annually in Mathematics, English Language Arts, and Science. I am interested in using the student performance data to identify areas of weakness in our program in terms of curricular alignment. For every question on a given assessment, the state releases an <strong>item description</strong> detailing what was asked of students and the corresponding average score earned by students in our school as well as the average score earned by students across Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong><em>My research question is</em></strong>: “Can test item descriptions on MCAS assessments be mined to extract features associated with student performance trends?”</p>
</section>
<section id="hypothesis" class="level1">
<h1>Hypothesis</h1>
<p>I have already found statistically significant patterns in student performance associated with an item’s content reporting category in every subject and grade level at our school.</p>
<p>In Mathematics, I have identified specific content reporting categories that are relative weaknesses at different grade levels; however, this does not take into account the differences in questions like those Uurrutia and Araya classified in open-ended Math prompts. I would be curious to see if our students are weaker in items that ask them to evaluate an expression (apply technical skills in algebra/numeracy) vs. construct or interpret a mathematical model (conceptual understanding). This would be very interesting information for teachers.</p>
<p>When interviewing one of our experienced teachers who has historical success with student achievement in English Language Arts (ELA), she identified specific things that she believes all kids need to practice for success with ELA, namely, “synthesizing multiple texts” and “practice at the differences in reading informational text vs. literature”. These are requirements in questions that can be mined from item descriptions but not from an item’s reporting category or standard description. Our students have historically performed weaker on the 7th grade English Language Arts exam than on the 6th and 8th grade exams. This suggests a curricular alignment issue. I’ve already identified reporting categories in which our students have performed relatively weaker on this assessment. I suspect that within these reporting categories there exist patterns to the types of questions or tasks that our students struggle with. This could provide valuable information for teachers to adjust their instruction and instructional materials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hypotheses</em></strong>:</p>
<p><strong><em>H1</em></strong>: A predictive model of student performance on Grade 5-10 Mathematics MCAS assessment items that includes regressors taken from the test item descriptions will outperform a baseline predictive model that includes only a given test item’s content reporting category.</p>
<p><strong><em>H2</em></strong>: A predictive model of student performance on Grade 5-10 English Language Arts MCAS assessment items that includes regressors taken from the test item descriptions will outperform a baseline predictive model that includes only a given test item’s content reporting category.</p>
<p><strong><em>H3</em></strong>: A predictive model of student performance on Grade 5-8 grade Science assessment items that includes regressors taken from the test item descriptions will outperform a baseline predictive model that includes only a given test item’s content reporting category.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-sources" class="level1">
<h1>Data Sources</h1>
<p>I scraped the <a href="https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/mcas/mcasitems2.aspx?grade=07&amp;subjectcode=ELA&amp;linkid=10&amp;orgcode=04830000&amp;fycode=2023&amp;orgtypecode=5&amp;">Department of Elementary and Secondary Educations’ accountability page</a>. It includes tables for all Next Generation MCAS tests (beginning in 2018) and text descriptions for all test items. I have actually already done this for the High School Science exams in my Python course last fall. The structures of the tables are similar for the other exams.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zCYUnbFfm-yqdpbM7R1O7iGeLj4kf1jU?usp=sharing">my folder of Collab notebooks</a> with my Python code for scraping different grade level and subjects. Here is a link to the notebook I used for the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1loau1tMkYkROXcua6MMuYMs5NwzI_gv5?usp=drive_link">HighSchool Science MCAS</a><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Math Corpus: 1010 Documents (item descriptions)</p></li>
<li><p>STE Corpus: 510 Documents, MS Only: 398 Documents</p></li>
<li><p>ELA Corpus: 693 Documents</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Uurrutia and Araya’s paper, they used <strong><em>classification</em></strong> to categorize open-ended mathematics questions into different types. I would like to use <strong><em>dictionaries</em></strong> to classify MCAS questions into different categories using the item descriptions.</p>
<p>Then I would like to use Supervised Machine Learning Methods that include the features created from the dictionaries as well as features that I extracted from the MCAS reporting tables to predict student performance relative to their peers in the state, <code>RT-State Diff</code>, on a given item.</p>
<p>I would like to use this same approach for the English Language Arts and Science exams as well.</p>

<h1>PreProcessing Approach</h1>
<p>For each exam I followed a similar approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a dataframe of all of the item descriptions and features across all grade levels and subjects. I kept as annotations all of the features provided by the state which include: <code>year</code>, <code>standard</code>, <code>reporting category</code>, <code>cluster</code> (sub category), <code>pts</code>, <code>state%</code>, <code>school%</code>, <code>school_state_diff</code>, and<code>type</code>(open response or selected response).</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>preText</code>, I looked for recommendations via the lowest score after running <code>factorial_preprocessing</code> and selected tokens accordingly. Interestingly, this recommended to not remove stop words in the Math and Science corpora. I believe this is perhaps because of the key logical role words like “and” ,“but”, “not”, and “or” play. These stop words do dominate the text descriptions though. Because of this, I also created a second set of tokens that included the removal of stopwords that I used for text visualizations and descriptive analysis of text. When applying dictionaries and using machine learning, I will use texts that include stop words. Also, whenever there was a recommendation to use stemming, I instead used lemmatization.</p></li>
<li><p>Create subset document matrices for the items that students performed the <strong>best</strong> on and a matrix for the items that student performed the <strong>worst</strong> on.</p></li>
<li><p>Create visuals of the word connections for all item descriptions as well as for the items descriptions in the <strong>best</strong> and <strong>worst</strong> subsets to explore differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Using n-grams, identify key phrases from the item descriptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a dictionary that uses key phrases identified in steps 4 and 5 to tag an item as including any of the following</p>
<p>Math:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>modeling</code>: A modeling problem</p></li>
<li><p><code>apply_division</code>: Problem requiring the use of division and division facts</p></li>
<li><p><code>patterns_algebra</code>: Problem requiring the manipulation of equivalent algebraic or numeric expressions</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ELA:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>poetry</code>: Students are asked questions involving where the source text is a poem</p></li>
<li><p><code>figurative_language</code>: question requiring the analysis of figurative language</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Science:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>analyze graph</code>: Students are asked questions involving the analysis of a graph</p></li>
<li><p><code>analyze model</code>: Students are asked questions involving the analysis of a model</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Update the <code>Subject_DF</code> to include the new features identified via the subject area dictionary for each of the documents to use as a feature for Supervised Machine Learning model that will predict <code>school_state_diff</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Before completing the pre-processing process, I examined the different choices using pre-Text. I was surprised to see that removing stop words had a positive correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>I can see how key logical words like “not”, “and”, and “or”, which are also stop words can have a significant impact on the meaning of an exam question. Perhaps, because each individual text is so small and the texts are designed for assessing content skills and are not narrative text, the stop words play more significant roles?</p>
<p>Given, these results, I will pre-process the data two ways, once using the lowest recommended score, <strong>N,</strong> but also going lowercase as I can’t see how this has an effect on anything and has a correlation coefficient of 0, and once using methods that includes removing stop words to use for text visualization and simple descriptive summaries of the text:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recommended preText score: “N-L” (remove punctuation and lowercase)</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative approach: “P-N-L-3” (remove punctuation, remove numbers, lower case, and n-grams)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly, some words like “determine”, “real-world”, and “expression” are top features from the Math tokens as a whole <strong><em>but</em></strong>, in the tokens taken only from the worst performing items, the word expression appears <strong><em>much</em></strong> more frequently than the phrase “real-world”, and this is the opposite in our best performing items and the entire corpus. Also, the word graph is a top-feature in the Math corpus and the best performing items but not a top-feature in the worst performing items.</p>

<p>I found it particularly interesting when I saw the connections on the worst performing subset vs.&nbsp;the best performing subset. There appears to be a theme of identifying equivalent expressions that only appears in the worst subset. Solving “real-world” problems; i.e.&nbsp;Modeling, appears strongly in both our best and worst subset. This makes me curious if there are certain mathematical topics where our students are struggling with the modeling problems. I will hopefully be able to explore this with topic modeling in the future.</p>
<p>Because of these patterns, I will create a dictionary to classify identify if an item requires <code>Modeling</code>, <code>apply_division</code>, or <code>patterns_algebra</code>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pretextpreprocessing-decisions-1">PreTextPreProcessing Decisions</h2>
<p>Before completing the pre-processing process, I examined the different choices using pre-Text. I was surprised to see that removing stopwords had a positive correlation coefficient; yet the combination “P-W” had the lowest score of the Pre-text results. I can see how key logical words like “not”, “and”, and “or”, which are also stop words can have a significant impact on the meaning of an exam question. Perhaps, because each individual text is so small and the texts are designed for assessing content skills and are not narrative text, the stop words play more significant roles?</p>
<p>Given, these results, I will pre-process the data two ways, once using the lowest recommended score and once using methods that I suspect based on my background knowledge of the topic and the individual regression coefficients should not impact the meaning of the text and reduce the number of tokens for analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recommended preText score: “P-W” (remove punctuation and stopwords)</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative approach: “P-N-L-W” + Lemmatization (remove punctuation, remove numbers, lower case, remove stopwords and lemmatization)</p>

<p>It was evident that the worst item tokens seem to largely represent text of items in the physical sciences. Our 9th grade students take a science exam that is only on Physics and as you can see below, they have performed weaker against their peers in the state compared to Rising Tide students at other grade levels. It would therefore, be worth exploring the worst items for Middle School (5th-8th grade) students. When I look at the Mifdle School student performance by Reporting Category, one of their weakest categories appears to be Physical Sciences. So this is also contributing to the dominance of Physical Science terms in the worst items tokens.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pretext-preprocessing-decisions">PreText PreProcessing Decisions</h2>
<p>Before completing the pre-processing process, I examined the different choices using pre-Text. I was surprised to see that removing stopwords had a positive correlation coefficient; yet the combination “P-W” had the lowest score of the Pre-text results. I can see how key logical words like “not”, “and”, and “or”, which are also stop words can have a significant impact on the meaning of an exam question. Perhaps, because each individual text is so small and the texts are designed for assessing content skills and are not narrative text, the stop words play more significant roles?</p>
<p>Given, these results, I will pre-process the data two ways, once using the lowest recommended score and once using methods that I suspect based on my background knowledge of the topic and the individual regression coefficients should not impact the meaning of the text and reduce the number of tokens for analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recommended preText score: “S-W-3” (remove stop words, Lemmatization/Stemming)</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative approach: “P-N-W-L” and Lemmatization (remove punctuation, remove numbers, lower case, and lemmatization)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="ELAPretextCoef.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Also, due to teacher input I am also creating a subcorpus of items that assessed Literature and items that assessed Informational text. Teachers describe having to change their approach to teaching these things and students having different weaknesses according to text type.</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>
<p><br>
At this phase, you might have more questions than answers. Document all those questions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Do you think that the sizes of the text corpa I have are now large enough?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have thoughts on the inclusion/exclusion of stop words. I went against what pretext recommended and found removing stopwords to still be helpful for the Science and Math descriptions. Is that ok?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m just leaving these prior questions here for me as a reference</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Urrutia and Araya article discussed creating linguistic features using <strong>dep/NumMod</strong> tokens and <strong>tag/Num</strong> tokens. I was wondering if there is a good place for me to read about and understand them as a concept?</p></li>
<li><p>The Varinhos article discusses the use of topic modeling. This is something I would be interested in applying. Is there a good place to read about the fundamentals of topic modeling?</p></li>

<span id="cb224-299"><a href="#cb224-299" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    though. Because of this, I also created a second set of tokens that</span>

<span id="cb224-635"><a href="#cb224-635" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Interestingly, some words like "determine", "real-world", and "expression" are top features from the Math tokens as a whole ***but***, in the tokens taken only from the worst performing items, the word expression appears ***much*** more frequently than the phrase "real-world", and this is the opposite in our best performing items and the entire corpus. Also, the word graph is a top-feature in the Math corpus and the best performing items but not a top-feature in the worst performing items.</span>

<span id="cb224-653"><a href="#cb224-653" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>worst performing subset vs. the best performing subset. There appears to</span>
<span id="cb224-654"><a href="#cb224-654" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>be a theme of identifying equivalent expressions that only appears in</span>

<span id="cb224-982"><a href="#cb224-982" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Before completing the pre-processing process, I examined the different</span>
<span id="cb224-983"><a href="#cb224-983" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>choices using pre-Text. I was surprised to see that removing stopwords</span>
<span id="cb224-984"><a href="#cb224-984" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>had a positive correlation coefficient; yet the combination "P-W" had</span>
<span id="cb224-985"><a href="#cb224-985" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>the lowest score of the Pre-text results. I can see how key logical</span>
<span id="cb224-986"><a href="#cb224-986" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>words like "not", "and", and "or", which are also stop words can have a</span>
<span id="cb224-987"><a href="#cb224-987" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>significant impact on the meaning of an exam question. Perhaps, because</span>
<span id="cb224-988"><a href="#cb224-988" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>each individual text is so small and the texts are designed for</span>
<span id="cb224-989"><a href="#cb224-989" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>assessing content skills and are not narrative text, the stop words play</span>
