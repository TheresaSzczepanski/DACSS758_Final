    "text": "In this tutorial, you’ll learn (or refresh your memory) about working in R, how to get your R workspace set up, how to do some basic work with data in R, and we’ll introduce a quick version of some (pretty though not necessarily useful) text analysis.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you should be familiar with the following:\n1. Load packages: install.packages(), library()\n2. Working directories: getwd(), setwd()\n3. Read in some data: read.csv()\n4. Look at data: str(), head(), tail()\n5. Piping: %&gt;% or |&gt;\n6. Manipulate data: group_by, summarise()\n\nBackground\nEach week, the tutorial will include all of the code to demonstrate some of the fundamental aspects of the work we are doing. The tutorials on the website include R code and output. If you would like to execute & edit the code, please download the .qmd file from Google Classroom, and execute & edit the code in RStudio.\nYou’ll do code inside of cells that look like this:\n\nx &lt;- 5\nx + 10\n\n[1] 15\n\n\nYou can run the code inside the cell by hitting the play button in the upper righthand side of the cell. When the code is running, you’ll notice that the play button transforms, indicating that the operation is being performed.\n\n\nFront-end Matters\nR itself has a base set of pre-programmed functions and operations that are included as soon as you open the program up. However, the real magic of R is in the user-contributed packages, which are all freely available online and easy — generally speaking — to add on to the base functionality. You can think of these as like the apps you add to your smart phone. While you can do a lot with your smart phone without doing anything, those apps provide a world of different ways of employing your phone. For R, packages serve the same purpose. When you start R up, then, you need to get the packages loaded. If you have never installed the packages before, you need to do that first:\n(since I have these packages already, I put a # mark in front of the code to stop it from running. If you don’t have these packages, make sure you delete the # mark before running the code.)\n\n#install.packages(\"quanteda\")\n#install.packages(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nOnce the packages are installed, you can load them as follows:\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda\")\n\nPackage version: 4.1.0\nUnicode version: 14.0\nICU version: 71.1\n\n\nParallel computing: disabled\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\n\nOccasionally, you’ll see conflicts between packages, and notes about a function in one program being masked from another program. For now, don’t worry about this. It arises because different programs will have similar functions with the same name. To return to the metaphor of the phone: it’s a bit like you may have multiple web browsers and you can choose from any of them to surf the web when, say, you click a link from a friend. There are some dangers associated with this, as some of those functions may be named the same thing but may actually do something slightly different. Again, though, this is a topic for another day.\n\n\nWorking Directories\nDirectories are the folders on a computer. Just as you navigate to different folders when you are looking for that ever elusive file that you can’t remember where you saved, you need to tell R where on your computer to look for data or other files. For new programmers, not understanding working directories (or the directory that R is currently working in) is one of the primary time sucks and sources of frustration. You can set the working directory using the drop down menu. You can also always check your working directory by entering getwd() (i.e., “get working directory”), and can change the working directory using setwd(). The latter requires that you enter the specific address of the folder on your machine (so, something like “~” on a Mac, or “c:” on a PC).\n\n\nReading in Data\nEach tutorial will be designed to work with a dataset that I provide and link to. At the most basic level, many packages include datasets as illustrative examples that we can pull on to explore the basics of that package. However, the code that we cover should — generally speaking — work with the data that you aim to work with this semester.\nWe’ll spend a lot of time during the Web Scraping week discussing the import of text data into R. For now, our focus will just be on getting a dataset into R that we can try out a few basic exploratory functions with. To do that, we can call down data directly from the web as so:\n\n# set up temporary file\ntemp &lt;- tempfile()\n\n# download file and store it in the temporary file\ndownload.file(\"http://scdb.wustl.edu/_brickFiles/2020_01/SCDB_2020_01_caseCentered_Citation.csv.zip\", temp)\n\n# the file is compressed, so we need to unzip it first\ndata &lt;- read.csv(unz(temp, \"SCDB_2020_01_caseCentered_Citation.csv\"))\n\n# if that all works, then you can check the number of observations or the number of rows by\nnrow(data)\n\n[1] 9030\n\n\n\n\nLooking at Data\nOnce the data is in, we can start to work with it. There’s really no limit on us from this point on. In the code chunk below, we’ll cover a few of the basics. Now that we are working with data, we’ll load the tidyverse. The tidyverse describes itself as “an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.” That’s about right; the packages are designed to improve on the base functionality of R in order to provide a better experience in working with data, conducting analyses, and creating visualizations. (make sure to install tidyverse if you haven’t done so.)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n# convert to tibble, the tidyverse dataframe format\ndata &lt;- as_tibble(data)\n\n# inspect the data\nstr(data)\n\ntibble [9,030 × 53] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ caseId                  : chr [1:9030] \"1946-001\" \"1946-002\" \"1946-003\" \"1946-004\" ...\n $ docketId                : chr [1:9030] \"1946-001-01\" \"1946-002-01\" \"1946-003-01\" \"1946-004-01\" ...\n $ caseIssuesId            : chr [1:9030] \"1946-001-01-01\" \"1946-002-01-01\" \"1946-003-01-01\" \"1946-004-01-01\" ...\n $ voteId                  : chr [1:9030] \"1946-001-01-01-01\" \"1946-002-01-01-01\" \"1946-003-01-01-01\" \"1946-004-01-01-01\" ...\n $ dateDecision            : chr [1:9030] \"11/18/1946\" \"11/18/1946\" \"11/18/1946\" \"11/25/1946\" ...\n $ decisionType            : int [1:9030] 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ usCite                  : chr [1:9030] \"329 U.S. 1\" \"329 U.S. 14\" \"329 U.S. 29\" \"329 U.S. 40\" ...\n $ sctCite                 : chr [1:9030] \"67 S.

Say you are interested in the average size of the majority coalition from a Supreme Court decision, or the mean number of majority votes in Supreme Court cases. We can calculate that as follows:\n\ndata %&gt;% \n  summarise(medianVotes = median(majVotes))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  medianVotes\n        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1           7\n\n\nFor folks that have worked with R and the tidyverse before, that should look familiar. But for others, here’s the idea of what we did there. First, we take the dataset (data) and pass it to a function via the pipe operator (%&gt;% or |&gt;). Then, we call a group of potential summary functions through summarise(), create a new variable called meanVotes, and set it’s value equal to the mean() of majVotes via mean(majVotes). We can see from R that the mean is approximately 7.1 during the entire time period under study here. We are probably more interested, though, in how divisiveness changes. For instance, has the divisiveness of the Court increased or decreased over time? We can do that by just adding another line to what we had above, as so:\n\ndata %&gt;% \n  group_by(term) %&gt;% \n  summarise(medianVotes = median(majVotes))\n\n# A tibble: 74 × 2\n    term medianVotes\n   &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1946           7\n 2  1947           7\n 3  1948           6\n 4  1949           7\n 5  1950           6\n 6  1951           7\n 7  1952           7\n 8  1953           7\n 9  1954           7\n10  1955           7\n# ℹ 64 more rows\n\n\nThat’s cool but it’s hard to see exactly what’s happening. Instead, let’s plot it out to have a look. Within the tidyverse, and probably it’s most popular package, is ggplot, or the “Grammar of Graphics” (i.e., gg). The underlying intuition is that we’ll be “layering” graphics; first you create a blank plot, then you start adding features to the plot. Here’s a basic plot for us:\n\n# pass the work we did above to ggplot\ndata %&gt;% \n  group_by(term) %&gt;% \n  summarise(meanVotes = mean(majVotes),\n            meanMinVotes = mean(minVotes)) %&gt;%\n  # then create the ggplot \"canvas\", specify our variables, then start \"adding\" (+) layers\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=term, y=meanMinVotes)) +\n    # our first layer creates a scatterplot\n    geom_point() + \n    # our second layer creates a smoothed fit across the points, a sort of moving average to give us a sense of how \n    # things have changed over time\n    geom_smooth() +\n    # our last layer is going to change the default style of the panel to a black and white theme\n    theme_bw()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere We Are Headed\nOf course, all of this is just working with formatted data, variables that others have already coded. What we are really interested in — and the reason you are taking this class — is to work with text-as-data. So what does the work that we’ll be doing look like?\nLet’s do a quick example. We’ll use the same piping command as before along with a host of functions from quanteda, the best text-as-data package out there for R. You can learn (a lot) more about quanteda here at the package website. We’ll be working with quanteda throughout the semester, and here’s a quick example of some basics of what we’ll do:\n\n# quanteda comes with a corpus of presidential inaugural speeches\n# this first line subsets that corpus to speeches later than 1953\ndfm_inaug &lt;- corpus_subset(data_corpus_inaugural, Year &gt;= 1954) |&gt;\n    # notice we are using the piping operator again.\n    # this time, we pipe the corpus to tokens, which is a single unit of text\n    # in creating it, we remove stop words (\"a\", \"it\", \"they\") and punctuation\n  tokens(remove_punct=TRUE) |&gt;\n    # now we pipe it to DFM, which creates a document-feature matrix\n    dfm() |&gt;\n    dfm_remove(stopwords('english')) |&gt;\n    # then we trim words that appear fewer than 50 times\n    dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 50, verbose = FALSE)\n\ntextplot_wordcloud(dfm_inaug)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have a nice word cloud! Don’t worry if you are unfamiliar with terms like corpus, document-feature matrix, and stop words. We will be covering and learning about these concepts throughout the semester. Here’s more exciting text analysis!"

These are:\n1. philosophers_stone: Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (1997)\n2. chamber_of_secrets: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998)\n3. prisoner_of_azkaban: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999)\n4. goblet_of_fire: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000)\n5. order_of_the_phoenix: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n6. half_blood_price: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005)\n7. deathly_hallows: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007)\nEach is stored as a character vector. A character vector is a collection of elements, where each element is a string. You could create your own character vector as something like:\n\nmy_char_vec &lt;- c(\"Rosemary's\", \"favorite\",\"horror movie\",\"director\", \"is\", \"James Wan.\")\nprint(my_char_vec)\n\n[1] \"Rosemary's\"   \"favorite\"     \"horror movie\" \"director\"     \"is\"          \n[6] \"James Wan.\"  \n\n\nEach element of a vector has an index; starting at 1, count from left-to-right. You can call to particular elements from the character vector using that indexing. So, if I wanted the third element from the above, I could type:\n\nmy_char_vec[3]\n\n[1] \"horror movie\"\n\n\nAs you can see in the example, an element doesn’t have to be a single word. Each element can be as long as you like. For instance, a character vector could also be:\n\nmy_char_vec2 &lt;- c(\"Rosemary's favorite horror movie director is James Wan.\", \"She has a James Wan figure in her office.\", \"She likes the Conjuring series the most.\")\nprint(my_char_vec2)\n\n[1] \"Rosemary's favorite horror movie director is James Wan.\"\n[2] \"She has a James Wan figure in her office.\"              \n[3] \"She likes the Conjuring series the most.\"               \n\n\nThe storage of the Harry Potter books follows this intuition. Each book is a character vector, and each chapter is an element in that book’s character vector. So, for philosophers_stone, we can see the first chapter via:\n\nphilosophers_stone[1]\n\n[1] \"THE BOY WHO LIVED  Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.  Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.  The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.  When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.  None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.  At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. `Little tyke,` chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.  It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.  But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.  Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.   `The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry`  Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.  He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...  He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.  `Sorry,` he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, `Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!`  And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.  Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.  As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. `Shoo!` said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (`Won't!`). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:  `And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.` The newscaster allowed himself a grin. `Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?`  `Well, Ted,` said the weatherman, `I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.`  Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...  Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. `Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?` As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.  `No,` she said sharply. `Why?`  `Funny stuff on the news,` Mr. Dursley mumbled. `Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...`  `So?` snapped Mrs. Dursley.  `Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.` Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name `Potter.` He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, `Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?`  `I suppose so,` said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.  `What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?`  `Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.`  `Oh, yes,` said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. `Yes, I quite agree.` He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.  Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.  The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them....  How very wrong he was.  Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.  A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.  Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.  Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, `I should have known.` He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.  `Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.`  He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.  `How did you know it was me?` she asked.  `My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.`  `You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,` said Professor McGonagall.  `All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.`  Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. `Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,` she said impatiently. `You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news.` She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. `I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.`  `You can't blame them,` said Dumbledore gently. `We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.`  `I know that,` said Professor McGonagall irritably. `But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.`  She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. `A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?` `It certainly seems so,` said Dumbledore. `We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?`  `A what?` `A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of`  `No, thank you,` said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. `As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -`  `My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.` Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. `It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.  `I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. `But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.`  `You flatter me,` said Dumbledore calmly. `Voldemort had powers I will never have.`  `Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them.`  `It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.`  Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, `The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?`  It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever `everyone` was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.  `What they're saying,` she pressed on, `is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. ` Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.  `Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... Oh, Albus...` Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. `I know... I know...` he said heavily.  Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. `That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.  Dumbledore nodded glumly.  `It's -- it's true?` faltered Professor McGonagall. `After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?`  `We can only guess,` said Dumbledore. `We may never know.`  Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, `Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?`  `Yes,` said Professor McGonagall. `And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?`  `I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.`  `You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?` cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. `Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!`  `It's the best place for him,` said Dumbledore firmly. `His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.`  `A letter?` repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. `Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!`  `Exactly,` said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. `It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?` Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, `Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?` She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.  `Hagrid's bringing him.` `You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?`  I would trust Hagrid with my life,` said Dumbledore.  `I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,` said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, `but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?`  A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.  If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.  `Hagrid,` said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. `At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?`  `Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,` said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. `Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir.`  `No problems, were there?`  `No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.`  Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.  `Is that where -?` whispered Professor McGonagall.  `Yes,` said Dumbledore. `He'll have that scar forever.`  `Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?`  `Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with.`  Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.  `Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?` asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.  `Shhh!` hissed Professor McGonagall, `you'll wake the Muggles!`  `S-s-sorry,` sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. `But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -`  `Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,` Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. `Well,` said Dumbledore finally, `that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.`  `Yeah,` said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, `I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.`  Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.  `I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,` said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.  Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.  `Good luck, Harry,` he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.  A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: `To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\""

    "text": "Tokens\nWe’ve used the phrase “tokens” in a few places now, and it’s time to dive into what we mean by it. Tokens are the individual component pieces of the text, and tokenizing is the process of breaking up the text into those component pieces. Consider the following tweet from President Trump:\nUnless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2,000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don't let Big Tech steal our Country, and don't let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!\nWe can start to break that into constituent words (“Unless”, “Republicans”, etc.) but notice that we pretty quickly have decisions to make. Should we include the punctuation marks (“,”, “.”, “!”) with a word? As unique tokens themselves? What about numbers like 2,000? Likewise, we have to decide whether to include the “$” with 2,000; you can see why that’d be important when you get a bit further and run into “Section 230”. Finally, what should we do with contractions like “Don’t”? Is that one word or two? And should we treat “Don’t” and “don’t” as the same token, or two different tokens?\nAll of these are choices that get nested into the tokenization process. The most basic versions of a tokenizer will split on white space; others are trained to split on a host of other characteristics. The big thing to know is to always look at the data you are creating.\n\n# the default breaks on white space\nphilosophers_stone_tokens &lt;-

Therefore, we can compound the tokens into a phrase using tokens_compound(). This creates a bigram; you can similarly create three-token phrases (trigram), four-token phrases (four-gram), and so on. Note that the newly created token will be the phrase separated by “_” (i.e., Daily_Prophet).\n\nphilosophers_stone_compound &lt;- tokens_compound(philosophers_stone_tokens,\n                pattern = phrase(\"Daily Prophet\"))\n\nhead(kwic(philosophers_stone_compound,\n          pattern = \"Daily_Prophet\"))\n\nKeyword-in-context with 3 matches.                                                              \n  [text5, 901] Hagrid read his newspaper the | Daily_Prophet |\n [text6, 5196]        It's been all over the | Daily_Prophet |\n [text8, 2909]        was a cutting from the | Daily_Prophet |\n                                                  \n Harry had learned from Uncle                     \n but I don't suppose you                          \n GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue\n\n\nOf course, you may also believe that there are lots and lots of potentially meaningful n-grams (i.e., uni-, bi-, tri-, four-, etc.) that you do not want to individually specify.

Here are some handy functions that can help us get a handle of the size and scope of our corpus now that we’re not going to be able to quickly see everything even in a summary page.\n\n# check the number of documents (here, total chapters in the 7 books)\nndoc(harry_potter_corpus)\n\n[1] 200\n\n# check the total length of the text (i.e., the total word count)\nsum(ntoken(harry_potter_corpus))\n\n[1] 1365970\n\nmax(ntoken(harry_potter_corpus))\n\n[1] 10956\n\n\nWe’ll learn other ways to characterize and explore the texts later this semester when we turn to the different manners in which we present them. For now, you should have all of the tools you need to get your own corpus set up in R, and to be able to identify a number of important characteristics (the size of the corpus in terms of documents and vocabulary, for instance)."

    "text": "Find TWO academic journal articles using Text Analysis Approaches in your field, or of the topics you are interested in. For each article, answer the questions below:\n\nArticle 1\nIn Uurrutia and Araya’s paper “Do Written Responses to Open-Ended Questions on Fourth Grade Online Formative Assessments in Mathematics Help Predict Scores on End-of-Year Standardized Tests?”, the authors explore the use of student responses to open-ended formative assessment questions to predict student performance on end-of-year tests. (Urrutia F. 2022)\n\n\n1. What is this paper’s research question?\n\nThe papers research question is: “To what extent do students’ short, written answers to teacher-designed, open-ended questions in weekly online formative tests help improve predictions of performance on end-of-the-year national multiple-choice standardized assessments?” (Urrutia F. 2022)\n\n\n2. What data does the paper use? How are the data collected?\n\nThe authors used a database of chilean students’ questions and answers from an online assessment platform called ConectaIdeas. Students completed formative assessments consisting of closed-ended (multiple choice) and open-ended (free-response) mathematics questions. The authors had the responses from 464 fourth grade students to 16,618 open-ended questions and 621,575 closed-ended questions. The authors used these responses and student performance data on the Sistema de Medición de la Calidad de la Educación (SIMCE) exam, a national exam given annually to Chilean students to build a model to predict student performance on SIMCE exams.\n\n3. What is the hypotheses of the paper? \n\nHypothesis: A predictive model of 4th grade student performance on the end of year SIMCE assessment that includes regressors taken from students’ responses to open-ended mathematics questions will outperform a baseline predictive model that includes only students’ scores on closed-ended mathematics questions.\n\n4. What text-as-data methods do the author(s) use? For example, sentiment analysis, classification, topic model, named-entity recognition, topic analysis, word embedding, etc.\n\nThe authors used two prediction models. One model would classify open-ended mathematics questions into one of 6 categories.\nThe second model would classify student responses as either coherent or incoherent. Incoherent answers were answers that consisted of noisy text, such as emojis or curse words as well as nonsensical responses.\n\n5. Based on your understanding of the paper, what is the usage of each text-as-data method? For example, sentiment analysis detects the sentiment of a sentence, such as fear, anger, etc.\nThe researchers used classification to develop models to predict if a student’s answer to an open-ended question was coherent. They used student answers to open-ended questions in 2019 and the corresponding teacher’s classification of responses as either incoherent or coherent to train the model. \nThey also used classification to develop models to categorize open-ended questions into different types:\n\nCalculate without explaining\nCalculate with explaining\nChoice and/or affirmation\nCompare quantities\nProcedure and content knowledge\nOther\n\nThe authors also extracted several linguistic features from the the student responses. These included: Number of dep/NumMod tokens and number of tag/Num tokens. They referenced other possible dependencies from this list: https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/.\n\n\n6. What are the findings of the paper?\n\nIn testing, 83.5% of the time, the Open-ended model, which included regressors using linguistic features of student open-response answers, was better than the baseline model at predicting student performance on the end of year exam in terms of \\(𝑅^2\\) (Urrutia F. 2022). Also, the correlation matrix of the Open-ended model was “more homogeneous and null than the that of the baseline model” indicating that the “Open-ended model regressors correlate less with each other than the baseline model regressors” (Urrutia F. 2022).\n\n7. What is your take on it?\n\nI think that it was very interesting that the authors were able to parse out student written responses as coherent or incoherent. I think that it is useful to categorize student responses that are filled with noisy text or emojis into a distinct category from student responses that are incoherent because the mathematics is illogical. Noisy text from a student indicates something about the student’s emotional state and is distinct from latent math ability. I found the features: “Ratio of Incoherent responses” to be very interesting. I can see how a student who is overhwelmed with writing or explanations might exhibit differences from other students with this variable. The other linguistic features seemed to me to be more indicative of a student’s overall writing skills. I see how this coupled with their response to multiple choice problems can give a more accurate picture of a students’ overall skill profile than multiple choice responses alone. The correlation matrix seems to suggest that the variables the authors constructed are measuring something seemingly independent from the latent skills measured by the multiple choice responses.\n\n8. (Optional) If you find the paper helpful to your research, try to find the replication file of the paper. \nI looked for a replication file and could not find one. I also looked on the author’s homepage. Perhaps since this involved student work it isn’t published?\n\n\nArticle 2\nIn the article Framework for Classroom Student Grading with Open-Ended Questions: A Text-Mining Approach, the authors apply text analysis techniques to student responses to open-ended questions in several grade level and subject areas(Vairinhos VM. 2022).\n\n1. What is this paper’s research question?\nCan text-mining be used to “extract objective, relevant, reliable and valid features” from student responses to open-ended questions (OEQ), in a way to allow the teacher to “construct, in real time, informed, unbiased and fact-based assessments” of student learning (Vairinhos VM. 2022)?\n\n2. What data does the paper use? How are the data collected?\nThe researchers collected three sets of observational data of students’ answers to tests with open response questions in Portuguese schools. The first data set was collected from student responses to questions on the official examinations of the Portuguese public educational system’s 12th year students. The responses were rated manually by teachers according to a rubric. The second data set consisted of 12th year student responses to open-response formative assessment questions in a Sociology class. The third data set consisted of University students’ response to open-response formative assessment questions in an Economics class. These data were stored in excel sheets with each row corresponding to an individual student’s response to a given question.\n\n3. What is the hypotheses of the paper? \nHypothesis: A classification model created from descriptive statistics on student responses to open-response questions will provide teachers with “valid and reliable summaries” of these texts.\n\n4. What text-as-data methods do the author(s) use? For example, sentiment analysis, classification, topic model, named-entity recognition, topic analysis, word embedding, etc.\nThe authors used token extraction and topic modeling to create linguistic features that they could summarize with descriptive statistics. The authors then built a model that estimates a students language and subject matter content skills to classify the quality of the overall response.\n\n5. Based on your understanding of the paper, what is the usage of each text-as-data method? For example, sentiment analysis detects the sentiment of a sentence, such as fear, anger, etc.\nThe authors used token extraction to gather information about students’ general use of language. They also used topic modeling to estimate how much of a student’s response contained text that was subadjacent to the topic of the question. The authors performed summary statistics on the linguistic features in student responses to create features in their classification model. The authors built a model that included as features estimates of a student’s lexical diversity , a student’s capability to structure text, and a student’s level of subject matter competence. With these features they used a student’s language and subject matter content skills to classify the quality of the overall response. The authors produced several visual representations using dendograms and biplots of the information in the classification models in the hope to give teachers quick visual summaries of key information from a student’s written response that a teacher could then combine with their observations of the student’s work to assign a grade.\n\n6. What are the findings of the paper?\nThe authors found that the correlation between official classifications of the texts from a grading panel and the classifications assigned by a Portuguese teacher hired for the research project were of the same magnitude as the correlations obtained between those teachers and results obtained by the authors’ model (although both correlations were surprisingly low). The authors also found that there was no significant difference between the distributions of standardized results obtained by the teachers and those suggested by the model.\n\n7. What is your take on it? \n\nI think that it is interesting to see the authors try to provide teachers with systems to more-efficiently grade open response items. This is a challenge for many teachers in the humanities. The authors noted in their findings that it was surprising that “the correlation between scores allocated by the official human correctors and those obtained by a Portuguese teacher hired by the second author” were “low” but of the same magnitude as the correlation of the model to the official correctors. This suggests to me that there is still a lot of work to be done to make this tool a valid and reliable estimate of how trained scoring panels would score the responses. If this model could be improved, could it eventually be more valid and reliable than a randomly selected teacher?\n\n\nFinal Project\nAfter reading the articles, think about the final project you want to do in this course, and answer the questions below:\n\n1. What research topic you want to study? Do you have a specific research question?\nI work for a public charter school in Massachusetts. Our students in Grades 5-10 are tested annually in Mathematics, English Language Arts, and Science. I am interested in using the student performance data to identify areas of weakness in our program in terms of curricular alignment. For every question on a given assessment, the state releases an item description detailing what was asked of students and the corresponding average score earned by students in our school as well as the average score earned by students across Massachusetts.\nMy research question is: “Can test item descriptions on MCAS assessments be mined to extract features associated with student performance trends?”\n\n2. Do you have any hypothesis/expected answer to your research question?\nI have already found statistically significant patterns in student performance associated with an item’s content reporting category in every subject and grade level at our school. When interviewing one of our experienced teachers who has historical success with student achievement in English Language Arts (ELA), she identified specific things that she believes all kids need to practice for success with (ELA), such as “synthesizing multiple texts”, “reading non-fiction”, and “identifying text features”. These are requirements in questions that can be mined from item descriptions but not from an item’s reporting category or standard description. Our students have historically performed weaker on the 7th grade English Language Arts exam than on the 6th and 8th grade exams. This suggests a curricular issue. I’ve already identified reporting categories in which our students have performed relatively weaker on this assessment. I suspect that within these reporting categories there exist patterns to the types of questions or tasks that our students struggle with. This could provide valuable information for teachers to adjust their instruction and instructional materials.\nSimilarly, in Mathematics I have identified specific content reporting categories that are relative weaknesses at different grade levels; however, this does not take into account the differences in questions like those Uurrutia and Araya classified in open-ended Math prompts. I would be curious to see if our students are weaker in items that ask them to evaluate an expression (apply technical skills) vs. construct or interpret a mathematical model (conceptual understanding). This would be very interesting information for teachers.\nHypotheses:\nH1: A predictive model of 7th grade student performance on 7th grade English Language Arts assessment items that includes regressors taken from the test item descriptions will outperform a baseline predictive model that includes only a given test item’s content reporting category.\nH2: A predictive model of 6th grade student performance on 6th grade Mathematics assessment items that includes regressors taken from the test item descriptions will outperform a baseline predictive model that includes only a given test item’s content reporting category.\n\n3. What are some potential data sources?\nI can scrape the Department of Elementary and Secondary Educations’ accountability page. It includes tables for all Next Generation MCAS tests (beginning in 2018) and text descriptions for all test items. I have actually already done this for the High School Science Exams in my Python course last fall. The structures of the tables are similar for the other exams.\n\n4. Is any of the text-as-data methods you identified in the journal articles may be helpful to your research?\nIn Uurrutia and Araya’s paper, they used classification to categorize open-ended mathematics questions into different types. I would like to classify the MCAS questions into different categories using the item descriptions.\nFor the Mathematics items, I would also like to use topic modeling to identify different topics within a given content reporting category. For example, Grade 6 students are assessed in the category Geometry on their ability to “Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume.” I would like to parse out if there are distinctions between their performance on tasks involving area versus tasks involving volume. Being able to classify a problem as an area versus volume problem would allow me to do this. On a broader level, I would like to distinguish between items that ask students to apply technical or computational skills versus constructing or interpreting models (conceptual understanding).\nFor the English Language Arts items, I would like to classify items as to whether or not they require the “synthesis of multiple texts” and whether or not they require the analysis of “text features”.\n\nAt this phase, you might have more questions than answers. Document all those questions.\n\nI have also downloaded PDFs of all of the released paper-based versions of the MCAS tests. Here is an example of a Math test. Do you think it would be possible to parse out the text of each question into a data frame? The question texts themselves would also be interesting to analyze. I was wondering if you think it is an achievable task. If so, I’m curious to see more about how to set up a corpus with texts contained in PDF files.\nFor any subject and grade level, my data set of text would consist of approximately 200 items and their corresponding text descriptions. Is that large enough?\nThe Urrutia and Araya article discussed creating linguistic features using dep/NumMod tokens and tag/Num tokens. I was wondering if there is a good place for me to read about and understand them as a concept?\nThe Varinhos article discusses the use of topic modeling. This is something I would be interested in applying. Is there a good place to read about the fundamentals of topic modeling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nUrrutia F., Araya R. 2022. “Do Written Responses to Open-Ended Questions on Fourth-Grade Online Formative Assessments in Mathematics Help Predict Scores on End-of-Year Standardized Tests?” Journal of Intelligence 10 (4): 97–111. https://doi.org/10.3390/jintelligence10040082.\n\n\nVairinhos VM., Matos F., Pereira LA. 2022. “Framework for Classroom Student Grading with Open-Ended Questions: A Text-Mining Approach.” Mathematics 10 (2). https://doi.org/10.3390/math10214152."

    "text": "This tutorial walks you through the process of using the package rvest to scrape websites using R. rvest (sounds like “harvest”, get it?) is the workhorse package for text scraping in R and contains all of the functionality for basic scraping applications. We’ll start by loading the package and tidyverse more generally so that we can use many of the tidyverse functions later on.\n\n#install.packages(\"rvest\")\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ readr::guess_encoding() masks rvest::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\nNicely Formatted Data\nLet’s start with a simple example; we’ll use the work from the Stanford Data Challenge Lab prepared by Sara Altman and Bill Behrman. Specifically, let’s say you are interested in the study of famines and come across this website. Wonderful! But how can we get this into a format for analysis? Time to waste a lot of hours on manually entering the data or maybe we have some spare funds to hire an undergrad…\nFortunately, that’s not true. With rvest this is arbitrarily easy. First, we can tell R the webpage we are looking at.\n\n# identify the url\nurl &lt;- \"https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines\"\n\nOf course, we can’t just read that webpage in because webpages are filled with all variety of — from our perspective — junk.\n\n# what happens when we just read that in; it's a full webpage\nread_html(url)\n\n{html_document}\n&lt;html class=\"js-disabled\"&gt;\n[1] &lt;head&gt;\\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...\n[2] &lt;body&gt;\\n&lt;header class=\"site-header\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"site-navigation-root\"&gt;&lt;di ...\n\n\nYeah, that’s not helpful. Instead, we need to identify just the table. This is the hardest part, but it’s not really too difficult. If you are familiar with HTML / CSS, then you might be able to just inspect the HTML to identify the correct selector. If you are in a Chrome browser, for instance, you can right click then select “Inspect”.\nIf you are less familiar, you can use SelectorGadget, a Chrome add-on that lets you — for whatever webpage you are visiting — “select” the portion of a page you are interested in scraping. SelectorGadget will then highlight whatever the Selector (in the bar at the bottom) would return. Once you’ve identified the Selector that works for the element of interest to you, you can add that to our code and you are off and running.\nNote that, especially if you aren’t familiar, this is going to take some time to get used to and require some patience and practice. Take a moment now to install the SelectorGadget Chrome extension, then play around with SelectorGadget on the website until you can correctly identify “table”, the CSS selector that will let us pull the table.\n\n# use SelectorGadget to find the info\ncss_selector &lt;- \"table\"\n\nOnce we have the correct selector, we still need to (1) read the full html, (2) select out the portion that we are interested in, and (3) start formatting. That third step is really particularly easy when what we are pulling is already in tabular format. So, for example, here’s how we could read our table of data on famines into R.\n\n# pull the table\nurl %&gt;%\n  read_html() %&gt;%\n  html_node(css = css_selector) %&gt;%\n  html_table()\n\n# A tibble: 77 × 6\n   Year      Country           Excess Mortality midpoin…¹ Excess Mortality low…²\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;chr&gt;                 \n 1 1846–52   Ireland           1,000,000                  1,000,000             \n 2 1860-1    India             2,000,000                  2,000,000             \n 3 1863-67   Cape Verde        30,000                     30,000                \n 4 1866-7    India             961,043                    961,043               \n 5 1868      Finland           100,000                    100,000               \n 6 1868-70   India             1,500,000                  1,500,000             \n 7 1870–1871 Persia (now Iran) 1,000,000                  500,000               \n 8 1876–79   Brazil            750,000                    500,000               \n 9 1876–79   India             7,176,346                  6,135,000             \n10 1877–79   China             11,000,000                 9,000,000             \n# ℹ 67 more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​`Excess Mortality midpoint`, ²​`Excess Mortality lower`\n# ℹ 2 more variables: `Excess Mortality upper` &lt;chr&gt;, Source &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nAnd if we wanted to save that, we’d just assign the prior chunk of code to an list item object. Then, we’d be ready for analysis.\n\n\nLess Nicely Formatted Data\nOf course, more likely than not we will be encountering data that aren’t so nice and tidy. This is particularly true for web scraping when the item of interest is text data, which rarely appear in tables like the one above.\nLet’s try out an example.

I am UMass alumni and was feeling nostalgic so when I started looking for rooms and came across the hotel (which I had forgotten was even there) I got excited about the prospect of being on the campus again.The good:  it really is a decent hotel.  Nice and modern and updated and comfortable.  They have water bottles in the room that can be used to get spring water downstairs for the duration of your stay.  I thought that this was a very nice touch since when I need a drink at night I usually end up using a plastic cup to get water out of the tap.  They also have a limited continental breakfast that does the job for some.  Would have been fine for me but left something to be desired for my kids.  The gentleman checking us in at the front desk was friendly and helpful.  We were only staying for one night during Thanksgiving so the campus was pretty much deserted but I would definitely come back and stay for longer.  The location in the center of campus in the student center with access to tons of food options and amenities is awesome.  Perfect spot from which to access and explore the entire campus.The not so good:  Hardly anything.  You only get one parking space in the garage.  Not usually an issue but because my mother was staying with us she had to pay the $20 parking fee.  Not a huge deal but I like open access to parking.  The bathroom was so teeny you can barely even turn around in there!  It does have a nice large stand-up shower which again was fine for me but my 8-year-old son lamented that he couldn't take a bath which he really wanted to do.   I would definitely recommend staying here if your main focus is seeing the campus.  You cannot beat the location and it's a pretty decent place.

Ya think they might actually have some staff on to handle the anticipated crowd trying to check inA long line of people being forced to wait for over an hour to simply check in!Helpful 1Helpful 2Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 1Love this 2Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n [3] \"Greg H.Wethersfield, CT04Jul 10, 2022They claim to have no rooms available during the summer but I have a hard time believing that.Helpful 1Helpful 2Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 0Love this 1Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n [4] \"Mike D.Elite 24Ridgefield, CT34248364May 9, 2019The great: location, location, location,they've got it and you want it. So they make you pay for it.

Pillows aren't very good, we bring ours.not very many outlets and no usb chargingThe ugly, no mini fridge for your stuff like a white wine, weird.

We were traveling to see our son and take in a show. Check in time was 3:00pm. We arrived at 3:15. There were several people in the lobby who all looked unhappy. The was a sign on the front desk that said due to staffing shortages the desk was closed and would open at 6. We left to take our son to dinner and a show. We call all the numbers for the hotel to no avail. We then called Umass police. They said many people had called. They did not know why it was not ope either. Now we are driving to Framingham to the closest hotel with availability. Do not stay there. Ruined a nice weekend.Helpful 3Helpful 4Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 1Love this 2Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n [6] \"Howie B.Elite 24Needham, MA45135568Jun 23, 2016It was wonderful to be back at my Alma Mater! Stayed two nights in connection with my son's New Student Orientation. It was a terrific stay and it is wonderfully convenient to be situated right on campus. Having attended in the '80s, the hotel always felt aesthetically cold - both inside and out (lots of poured concrete will do that. Housed in the university's Campus Center, one of the New Student Program tour guides referred to the hotel's exterior as looking like a \\\"waffle iron.\\\" I had never heard that before, yet it is indeed true.) However, as new buildings continue to rise up around it, the Campus Center building seems to have become more charming over the years.Inside the hotel they have professionalized their operation and \\\"warmed-up\\\" the public spaces, redecorated their rooms and offer amenities like a substantial continental breakfast and free wifi (there was no wifi back in the '80s :-) There are amazing food options in the new Blue Wall on the Campus Center concourse level. Previously an aged bar on campus, this has been totally redesigned as a state-of-the-art \\\"food court\\\" with eye-popping selections (a bakery, gelateria, Mexican and Asian stations, sushi, deli, pizza, salad bar, and much more (UMASS's food service is among the most-awarded for colleges and universities in the US!)We stayed in a \\\"pond view\\\" room which offered a stunning (at least it was to me) view of the center of campus. The room was very clean, updated and well-appointed. The bed was among the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The bathroom, which was on the small side making it difficult to close the door once inside, was updated and was serviceable. One small gripe is that they don't provide bar soap in the shower, instead providing a tiny tube of body wash. I actually ran into the Hotel Manager, Rachelle Allen, during my stay (she could not have been more personable and lovely) and noted this to her. She indicated that this is done in an effort to economize and avoid waste. However, she said she would be happy to send up bar soap if requested.This was a wonderful and very pleasant stay and it was great to be back on campus. I look forward to many more stays over the next four years!Helpful 2Helpful 3Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 0Love this 1Oh no 0Oh no 1\"\n [7] \"Kat Y.Elite 24Newport, RI37206277Mar 9, 2019Clean, easy, convenient.

Staff were very friendly on check-in and quickly got me settled in my quiet room with good views of the surrounding campus. The two-queen room was spacious and very clean. My only cons would be the wireless internet (good speed, reliable) seemed to kick you off a few times per day and force you to re-enter the password each time, and it was very quiet - nice to have at least a fan on the AC unit that can create a little white noise for sleeping at night. Breakfast buffet in the morning, cookies on the check-in counter, lots of nice touches.

The central campus location of UMass Hotel Campus Center is not only the most convenient, it's actually picturesque. They offer a view of the little pond and the trees in late autumn are particularly breathtaking - the entrance plaza stairs could even be called artistic.  UMass offers a reduced rate specific for students and their guests. They offer the most convenient location for walking to campus events at the Mullins Center and other facilities. They offer indoor swimming pool access. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Although simple accommodations, it still makes for a very comfortable setting.  Qualifies for my Best of the A10 list... no other hotel in Amherst or Springfield comes close to providing the same convenience or at-home feeling.Helpful 2Helpful 3Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 0Love this 1Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n[11] \"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n\n\nThere are 10 reviews on each page, but we find an extra empty review [11].

I am UMass alumni and was feeling nostalgic so when I started looking for rooms and came across the hotel (which I had forgotten was even there) I got excited about the prospect of being on the campus again.The good:  it really is a decent hotel.  Nice and modern and updated and comfortable.  They have water bottles in the room that can be used to get spring water downstairs for the duration of your stay.  I thought that this was a very nice touch since when I need a drink at night I usually end up using a plastic cup to get water out of the tap.  They also have a limited continental breakfast that does the job for some.  Would have been fine for me but left something to be desired for my kids.  The gentleman checking us in at the front desk was friendly and helpful.  We were only staying for one night during Thanksgiving so the campus was pretty much deserted but I would definitely come back and stay for longer.  The location in the center of campus in the student center with access to tons of food options and amenities is awesome.  Perfect spot from which to access and explore the entire campus.The not so good:  Hardly anything.  You only get one parking space in the garage.  Not usually an issue but because my mother was staying with us she had to pay the $20 parking fee.  Not a huge deal but I like open access to parking.  The bathroom was so teeny you can barely even turn around in there!  It does have a nice large stand-up shower which again was fine for me but my 8-year-old son lamented that he couldn't take a bath which he really wanted to do.   I would definitely recommend staying here if your main focus is seeing the campus.  You cannot beat the location and it's a pretty decent place.

What kind of hotel has only one clerk on during a rush period? After a long day and Football game we went to check in an there was a line of at least 20 people waiting to check in. Ya think they might actually have some staff on to handle the anticipated crowd trying to check inA long line of people being forced to wait for over an hour to simply check in!Helpful 1Helpful 2Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 1Love this 2Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n [3] \"Greg H.Wethersfield, CT04Jul 10, 2022They claim to have no rooms available during the summer but I have a hard time believing that.Helpful 1Helpful 2Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 0Love this 1Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n [4] \"Mike D.Elite 24Ridgefield, CT34248364May 9, 2019The great: location, location, location,they've got it and you want it. So they make you pay for it.

Pillows aren't very good, we bring ours.not very many outlets and no usb chargingThe ugly, no mini fridge for your stuff like a white wine, weird.

We were traveling to see our son and take in a show. Check in time was 3:00pm. We arrived at 3:15. There were several people in the lobby who all looked unhappy. The was a sign on the front desk that said due to staffing shortages the desk was closed and would open at 6. We left to take our son to dinner and a show. We call all the numbers for the hotel to no avail. We then called Umass police. They said many people had called. They did not know why it was not ope either. Now we are driving to Framingham to the closest hotel with availability. Do not stay there. Ruined a nice weekend.Helpful 3Helpful 4Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 1Love this 2Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n [6] \"Howie B.Elite 24Needham, MA45135568Jun 23, 2016It was wonderful to be back at my Alma Mater! Stayed two nights in connection with my son's New Student Orientation. It was a terrific stay and it is wonderfully convenient to be situated right on campus. Having attended in the '80s, the hotel always felt aesthetically cold - both inside and out (lots of poured concrete will do that. Housed in the university's Campus Center, one of the New Student Program tour guides referred to the hotel's exterior as looking like a \\\"waffle iron.\\\" I had never heard that before, yet it is indeed true.) However, as new buildings continue to rise up around it, the Campus Center building seems to have become more charming over the years.Inside the hotel they have professionalized their operation and \\\"warmed-up\\\" the public spaces, redecorated their rooms and offer amenities like a substantial continental breakfast and free wifi (there was no wifi back in the '80s :-) There are amazing food options in the new Blue Wall on the Campus Center concourse level. Previously an aged bar on campus, this has been totally redesigned as a state-of-the-art \\\"food court\\\" with eye-popping selections (a bakery, gelateria, Mexican and Asian stations, sushi, deli, pizza, salad bar, and much more (UMASS's food service is among the most-awarded for colleges and universities in the US!)We stayed in a \\\"pond view\\\" room which offered a stunning (at least it was to me) view of the center of campus. The room was very clean, updated and well-appointed. The bed was among the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The bathroom, which was on the small side making it difficult to close the door once inside, was updated and was serviceable. One small gripe is that they don't provide bar soap in the shower, instead providing a tiny tube of body wash. I actually ran into the Hotel Manager, Rachelle Allen, during my stay (she could not have been more personable and lovely) and noted this to her. She indicated that this is done in an effort to economize and avoid waste. However, she said she would be happy to send up bar soap if requested.This was a wonderful and very pleasant stay and it was great to be back on campus. I look forward to many more stays over the next four years!Helpful 2Helpful 3Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 0Love this 1Oh no 0Oh no 1\"\n [7] \"Kat Y.Elite 24Newport, RI37206277Mar 9, 2019Clean, easy, convenient.

Staff were very friendly on check-in and quickly got me settled in my quiet room with good views of the surrounding campus. The two-queen room was spacious and very clean. My only cons would be the wireless internet (good speed, reliable) seemed to kick you off a few times per day and force you to re-enter the password each time, and it was very quiet - nice to have at least a fan on the AC unit that can create a little white noise for sleeping at night. Breakfast buffet in the morning, cookies on the check-in counter, lots of nice touches.

The central campus location of UMass Hotel Campus Center is not only the most convenient, it's actually picturesque. They offer a view of the little pond and the trees in late autumn are particularly breathtaking - the entrance plaza stairs could even be called artistic.  UMass offers a reduced rate specific for students and their guests. They offer the most convenient location for walking to campus events at the Mullins Center and other facilities. They offer indoor swimming pool access. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Although simple accommodations, it still makes for a very comfortable setting.  Qualifies for my Best of the A10 list... no other hotel in Amherst or Springfield comes close to providing the same convenience or at-home feeling.Helpful 2Helpful 3Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 0Love this 1Oh no 0Oh no 1\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n\n\nThat’s great, but as you can see it only pulls the first 10 reviews. We’d ideally like to have them all. To do so, we need to iterate through the pages. This takes some understanding of how Yelp sets up their website. Here’s the URL we were using\n\nurl\n\n[1] \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass\"\n\n\nIf you head to that webpage, you’ll notice that only the first set of reviews is actually present. How might we get the second set? The easiest way would be if we could identify some standard language that Yelp is using that we can then leverage to “loop” through each page (that is, run the same operation as above for each page). To see how Yelp lays everything out, click through to the second page of reviews. Here’s the URL for that page, and a comparison of the two URLs.\n\nnew_url &lt;- \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass&start=10\"\n\n# print these next to each other\nurl\n\n[1] \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass\"\n\nnew_url\n\n[1] \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass&start=10\"\n\n\nAha! That shows us how they are indexing the pages, with a little statement :“&start=10”. The indexing here is kind of weird but if you click on the next set, you’ll see that 10 jumps up to 20. So they are counting by 10 and creating a new page each time. We can use that to set up a loop. Ostensibly, you could identify the total number of pages is 4 pages. The first page is — as we just saw — unnumbered, and then each thereafter is indexed by 10. Because the first is unnumbered, we’ll subtract one from our number of pages to loop through.\n\n# create the indices\npageNumber &lt;- 10 * c(1:3)\n# get an idea of what we just created\nhead(pageNumber)\n\n[1] 10 20 30\n\nlength(pageNumber)\n\n[1] 3\n\n# set up a new vector to store the urls\nurls &lt;- url\n\n# loop through the page numbers and create the new urls\nfor (i in 1:length(pageNumber)){\n  urls &lt;- c(urls, paste(\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass&start=\",pageNumber[i], sep = \"\"))\n}\n\n# look at the first few\nhead(urls)\n\n[1] \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass\"         \n[2] \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass&start=10\"\n[3] \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass&start=20\"\n[4] \"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-umass-amherst?osq=hotel+umass&start=30\"\n\n\nNow that we have all of the urls, we can loop through each pulling the reviews from each page. To do so, we need to create a new vector that will store all of the reviews; otherwise, we’ll just be overwriting our review object in each loop.\nNote that this will take a couple of minutes; we’re iterating through 4 pages after all.\n\n# set up an empty vector to store reviews\nreviews &lt;- c()\n\n# loop through urls\nfor (i in 1:length(urls)){\n  # extract reviews for this url\n  tmpReviews &lt;- urls[i] %&gt;%\n  read_html() %&gt;%\n  html_nodes(css = css_selector1) %&gt;%\n  html_text()\n\n  # add them to the set of reviews\n  reviews &lt;- c(reviews,tmpReviews)\n}\n\n#filter out empty reviews\nreviews &lt;- reviews[reviews != \"\"]\n\n# look at the 12th reviews\nreviews[15]\n\n[1] \"Barbara A.Elite 24East Watertown, MA605645277Apr 17, 2013This brings back memories ... they last time I was here, I was a senior in college and I just lost my housing and had no where to go.  Luckily, every year, my mom would make a reservation here for herself so she could rest up before heading home after dropping me off.  Nice improvements! The rooms are very nice if not still on the small side, but I will take clean over size any day.  If you have to be on campus early, I suggest staying here so you can just roll out and go.  We had gone to dinner before we checked in and brought back leftovers but ... there was no fridge.  We looked everywhere because we were so sure there would be one but no.  They have complimentary water in the room and they have continental breakfast which is decent.The -1 star for check in  ... we got there about 10 pm and we waited but no one was at the desk (and a line was forming behind me).  I finally ended up calling the hotel and saying could someone take care of the people at the front desk and they were right on it. Other than that, a good hotel experience.Helpful 1Helpful 2Thanks 0Thanks 1Love this 1Love this 2Oh no 0Oh no 1\"\n\n\nThere’s a few things we’d want to do from here. We could expand the extraction to identify all sorts of other aspects of each review — the name, location, and prior reviews by a reviewer; the overall rating as well as the rating across different categories; and so on — and add those extractions to each stage of our loop. We’ll leave those steps to future analyses.\n\n\nA Quick Analysis\nWith the text scraped from the site, we can use a bit of what we’ve done in past tutorials (and will continue to do going forward) to take a look at what folks are saying about Hotel UMass.\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nPackage version: 4.1.0\nUnicode version: 14.0\nICU version: 71.1\n\n\nParallel computing: disabled\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\nlibrary(quanteda.textplots)\n\n# convert to corpus\nhotel_corpus &lt;- corpus(reviews)\n\n# create a word cloud\nhotel_dfm &lt;- tokens(hotel_corpus, remove_punct=TRUE) %&gt;%\n          tokens_select(pattern=stopwords(\"en\"),\n          selection=\"remove\") %&gt;%\n          dfm()\n\ntextplot_wordcloud(hotel_dfm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to find a pattern. Since we included the buttons “helpful”, “thanks”, etc. under the reviews, the most common words are “1love”, “0oh”. Also, since we are interested in hotel reviews, we also see common words such as “hotel”, “rooms”, “campus”, etc. Let’s see if we can remove these words.\n\nhotel_dfm2 &lt;- tokens(hotel_corpus,\n                     remove_punct=TRUE,\n                     remove_numbers = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  tokens_select(pattern=c(stopwords(\"en\"),\n          \"hotel\",\"rooms\",\"room\",\"umass\",\"campus\"),selection=\"remove\") %&gt;%\n  ## Regular expression that matches words that start with numbers followed by letters\n    tokens_select(pattern = \"^\\\\d+\\\\w+$\", selection = \"remove\", valuetype = \"regex\") %&gt;%\n             dfm()\n\ntextplot_wordcloud(hotel_dfm2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the reviews are pretty obvious! Good job Hotel UMass!\n\n\nConclusion\nEverything here worked well. But what if we have a website that doesn’t follow the same nice URL nomenclature / pattern that we found above? In that case, we’ll need to resort to RSelenium. We’ll leave that for another tutorial."
